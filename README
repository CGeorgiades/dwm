# My version of dwm
## Changes the tag system structure as so:

Normal DWM:
     Clients <= Monitor <= Tags

With modifications:
	Clients <= Tags <= Monitors

Under this system, the tags are monitor-independent.
So, the monitors select which tag (and clients) they are showing

There are also different workspaces added. The default to switch workspaces is Shift+Tab.
Each workspace has its own, independent, set of tags
By default, to send a client to a workspace, use Ctrl+'N', where N is a number 1-4.

Under my system the TagKeys are Meta+N and Alt+N, where N is a number 1-4
